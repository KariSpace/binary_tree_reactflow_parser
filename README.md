# binary_tree_reactflow_parser
Binary tree data structure on Python to parse data from frontend. Flow being created based on https://reactflow.dev/ and than being parsed based on order data


I receive this data from Shopify app and apply similar rules on order paid.
This code was migrated to Typescript project, so current one was deprecated
